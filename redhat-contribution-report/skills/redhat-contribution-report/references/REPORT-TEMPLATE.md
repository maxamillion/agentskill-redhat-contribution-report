## Data Quality & Methodology

### Methodology
- Employee roster obtained via LDAP traversal from {manager_email} using GSSAPI authentication
- GitHub usernames resolved via LDAP rhatSocialURL attribute, git log email matching, and gh user search
- PR/commit data sampled from most recent {count} merged PRs per project
- Governance roles identified from repository governance files (OWNERS, CODEOWNERS, MAINTAINERS) and web research
- Leadership positions identified from project governance documentation and foundation websites

### Data Quality Notes
{List any issues encountered:}
- {e.g., "Rate limiting encountered for project X - PR sample reduced to 200"}
- {e.g., "No governance files found for project Y - KPI 3 and 5 based on web research only"}
- {e.g., "15 employees could not have GitHub usernames resolved"}

### Confidence Legend
- **High:** Data from authoritative sources (GitHub API, LDAP, governance files in repository)
- **Medium:** Data from semi-structured sources or employee resolved via git log email match
- **Low:** Data from web search or employee resolved via name-based GitHub user search
- **Not Found:** Could not find data for this metric
